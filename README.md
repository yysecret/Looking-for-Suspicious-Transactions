# Looking-for-Suspicious-Transactions

## Part 1

On average, there are 9.2% transactions which are less than $2 for each card holder. The maximum percentage is 14%, and the minimum percentage is 4%. We don't have evidence to suggest the a credit card has been hecked.  

The number of transacitons make between 7:00 am and 9:00 am is 275, and 7.9% of the total number of transactions which is 3500. Among the highest 100 transactions during this time,16 of them are for bar, 21 of them are for coffee shop, 29 of them are for food truck,14 of the are for pub, and 29 of them are for restaurant. But there are seven transactions above $1000, they may be fraudulent transactions.

Based on the number of less than $2.00 transactions, the top 5 merchants prone to being hacked using small transacitons are Wood-Ramirez, Hood-Phillips, Baker Inc, Mcdaniel, Hines and Mcfarland,and Hamilton-Mcfarland.


## Part 2
Based on the combined plot for card holder 2 and 18, we can tell that they have different patterns, card holder 2 has no abnormal high expenses, but it has possibility to be hacked by small amount fraudulent transactions. For card holder 18, there are a few irregular high expenses of which need to be taken care. 

There are a few outliers for card holder 25. 1 in January, 0 in February, one in March, and 3 in April. The number of outliers in April is higher than that in other months, we may do more research to figure out whether they are fraudulent transactions or not.
